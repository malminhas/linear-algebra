    "The **norm** of a vector is a measure of its length. There are many ways of defining the length of a vector depending on the metric used (i.e., the distance formula chosen). The most common is called the **$L_2$ norm**, which is computed according to the distance formula you are probably familiar with from school. The $L_2$ norm of a vector $v$ is denoted by $||{v}||_2$ and $||{v}|| = \\sqrt{{\\sum_i}{v_i^2}}$. This is sometimes also called Euclidian length and refers to the “physical” length of a vector in 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D space. The **$L_1$ norm**, or “Manhattan Distance,” is computed as $||{v}||_1 = {\\sum_i}|{v_i}|$, and is named after the grid-like road structure in New York City. The **p-norm**, $L_p$, of a vector is $\\vert\\vert{v}\\vert\\vert_p = \\sqrt[p]{{\\sum_i}{v_i^p}}$. The **$L_\\infty$ norm**, where $p=\\infty$ is written as $||𝑣||_\\infty$.

The matrix, 𝐴, is also full rank if all of its columns are linearly independent. An augmented matrix. is a matrix, 𝐴, concatenated with a vector, 𝑦, and is written [𝐴,𝑦]. This is commonly read “𝐴 augmented with 𝑦.”  You can use np.concatenate to concatenate the them. If 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘([𝐴,𝑦])=𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘(𝐴)+1, then the vector, 𝑦, is “new” information. That is, it cannot be created as a linear combination of the columns in 𝐴. The rank is an important property of matrices because of its relationship to solutions of linear equations."
