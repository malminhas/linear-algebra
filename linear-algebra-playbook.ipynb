    "The **norm** of a vector is a measure of its length. There are many ways of defining the length of a vector depending on the metric used (i.e., the distance formula chosen). The most common is called the **$L_2$ norm**, which is computed according to the distance formula you are probably familiar with from school. The $L_2$ norm of a vector $v$ is denoted by $||{v}||_2$ and $||{v}|| = \\sqrt{{\\sum_i}{v_i^2}}$. This is sometimes also called Euclidian length and refers to the ‚Äúphysical‚Äù length of a vector in 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D space. The **$L_1$ norm**, or ‚ÄúManhattan Distance,‚Äù is computed as $||{v}||_1 = {\\sum_i}|{v_i}|$, and is named after the grid-like road structure in New York City. The **p-norm**, $L_p$, of a vector is $\\vert\\vert{v}\\vert\\vert_p = \\sqrt[p]{{\\sum_i}{v_i^p}}$. The **$L_\\infty$ norm**, where $p=\\infty$ is written as $||ùë£||_\\infty$.

    "The **rank** of an ùëö√óùëõ matrix ùê¥ is the number of linearly independent columns or rows of ùê¥, and is denoted by rank(ùê¥). It can be shown that the number of linearly independent rows is always equal to the number of linearly independent columns for any matrix. A matrix is called full rank. if rank (ùê¥)=min(ùëö,ùëõ). The matrix, ùê¥, is also full rank if all of its columns are linearly independent. An augmented matrix. is a matrix, ùê¥, concatenated with a vector, ùë¶, and is written [ùê¥,ùë¶]. This is commonly read ‚Äúùê¥ augmented with ùë¶.‚Äù  You can use np.concatenate to concatenate the them. If ùëüùëéùëõùëò([ùê¥,ùë¶])=ùëüùëéùëõùëò(ùê¥)+1, then the vector, ùë¶, is ‚Äúnew‚Äù information. That is, it cannot be created as a linear combination of the columns in ùê¥. The rank is an important property of matrices because of its relationship to solutions of linear equations."
